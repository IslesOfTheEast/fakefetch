# fakefetch

### what is fakefetch?

fakfetch is a small screenfetch like script for my linux desktop that is written in python. 

I am currently adding lots of ascii art so users of fakefetch will be able to find something that suites their desktop.

* then type:

Please note! this will not work on windows.
